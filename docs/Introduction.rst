Introduction
=============

SBMLKinetics is a Python package to evaluate and classify kinetics in SBML models. 
There are many possible kinetics like zeroth order, mass action, Michaelis-Menten, 
Hill kinetics and others. This work characterizes the kinetics used in the BioModels 
Database to improve modeling best practices. Our tool can analyze any data sets with SBML files 
as input. Users can also use this tool to compare different data sets. For instance, we 
compare the distribution of kinetics for signaling and metabolic networks and find the 
substantial differences between two types of networks. If you are using any of the code, 
please cite the PYPI web page (https://pypi.org/project/SBMLKinetics/).
