Kinetic law type (K type) including ten types "ZERO" (Zeroth order), "UNDR" 
(Uni-directional mass action), "UNMO" (Uni-term with moderator), "BIDR" 
(Bi-directional mass action), "BIMO" (Bi-terms with moderator), "MM" 
(Michaelis-Menten kinetics without explicit enzyme), "MMCAT" 
(Michaelis-Menten kinetics with explicit enzyme), "HILL" (Hill equations), 
"FR" (Kinetics in the format of fraction other than MM, MMCAT or HILL) and "NA" 
(not classified kinetics). 

Mass transfer type (M type) is quantitatively represented by the number of reactants 
(r = 0, 1, 2, 3 (representing>2)) and products (p= 0, 1, 2, >2 (representing > 2)).
